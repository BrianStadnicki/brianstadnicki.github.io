Sample This sample is from any.run.

It was released for the following platforms:
Nintendo 3DS PlayStation 3 Wii Wii U Xbox 360 As much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to believe that the game was ported to PC, it&amp;rsquo;s way more likely that this is malware, especially given how SEO-optimized it is and the list in the blog archive.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of FreeBitco.in Next Roll Prediction</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/malware-freebitcoin-next-roll-prediction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/malware-freebitcoin-next-roll-prediction/</guid><description>Malware obtained from any.run. It&amp;rsquo;s a bitcoin scam executable.

Both of these dropped executables are .NET assemblies, so they should be trivial to reverse.
gons.exe Opening gons in dnSpy shows that this executable is responsible for the GUI, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice any malicious behaviour initially.</description></item><item><title>Failed to modify a data converter</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/fiverr-data-converter-modification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/fiverr-data-converter-modification/</guid><description>An interesting Fiverr project I got recently is modifying the EXFO Toolbox data converter to allow excel files. This toolbox is used for fibre optic measurements. The client wants to be able to change a few values in the measurements which can&amp;rsquo;t be done using the tool.
Overview It&amp;rsquo;s quite a simple part of the program, just select the 2 files to merge and tada. Issue is, it merges OLTS/OLTS2 files, not the excel file requested.</description></item><item><title>Cracking Marquire's CrackMe_V3_Marquire</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/crackmes-marquier-crackme-v3-marquire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/crackmes-marquier-crackme-v3-marquire/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start off the crackmes series with a basic one: Marquire&amp;rsquo;s CrackMe_V3_Marquire .
Property Value Language C/C++ Platform Windows Difficulty 1.3 Quality 4.3 Arch x86 Initial run It&amp;rsquo;s very standard, it just asks for the key and tells us if it&amp;rsquo;s right or wrong.
Initial analysis It&amp;rsquo;s quite clear what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description></item><item><title>Extending an Iveco activator to 2030</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/fiverr-extend-iveco-activator-to-2030/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/fiverr-extend-iveco-activator-to-2030/</guid><description>A customer on Fiverr sent me a copy of the Iveco easy activator v1.01. This looks to be a key generator to program Iveco trucks. The customer has requested that I add the years up to 2030 to it, as the tool only works from 2017 to 2020. Nice to see future proofing, even if I really doubt the key algorithm won&amp;rsquo;t change in that time.
Running it First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s run it and see what we&amp;rsquo;re working with.</description></item><item><title>My startup: Tradesmen Bookings</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/tradesmen-bookings-begin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/tradesmen-bookings-begin/</guid><description>A project I started 4 months ago is tradesmen bookings. Property management services currently manage their tradesmen through calling, which is expensive, so I decided to write a SaaS tool that would optimise this. No calling, just post a job and the tradesmen apply.
Development It&amp;rsquo;s written in ruby on rails, which was honestly quite painful to get started on. I&amp;rsquo;m not typically involved in web development, so it was quite a giant learning curve, felt like the learning curve of Eve.</description></item><item><title>Rust Reversing 1: Hello, world!</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/rust-reversing-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/rust-reversing-01/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of decompilers for most compiled languages, but what about rust? I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one, so let&amp;rsquo;s try to understand what the resulting code looks like, in the hopes of creating a decompiler. Might help out somebody going against an odd malware author who&amp;rsquo;s decided that rust makes sense (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t).
Fair warning, this is my first dive into assembly reverse engineering since I did basic crackmes a few years ago, so be prepared for vagueness while I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a developer and reverse engineer, with 3+ years of experience.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Email me</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/projects/</guid><description>418 I&amp;rsquo;m a teapot</description></item><item><title>Quips</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/quips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/quips/</guid><description>A random collection of quips I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up, sorry about no attributions.
