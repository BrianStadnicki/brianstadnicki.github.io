It ran from 03/12/21 8pm to 05/12/21 8pm, in which time we solved 32 challenges, gathering 6925 points. We came 41st in the students leaderboard and 96th overall, that&amp;rsquo;s very good for our first CTF.
I learnt a lot from this CTF, especially about what I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.
As you can see, Reconnaissance and Forensics were our strongest categories.</description></item></channel></rss>
