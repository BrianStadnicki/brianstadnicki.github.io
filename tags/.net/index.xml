It doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to have been involved in any significant incidents yet, a few minecraft players don&amp;rsquo;t count. Unsurprisingly therefore, the sample has not had a single transaction to the wallet.

It appears to be a trojan tricking people who can&amp;rsquo;t afford Kasperky with a RAT, with the kasperky logo to match.
