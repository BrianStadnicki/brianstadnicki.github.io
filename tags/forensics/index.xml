It ran from 03/12/21 8pm to 05/12/21 8pm, in which time we solved 32 challenges, gathering 6925 points. We came 41st in the students leaderboard and 96th overall, that&amp;rsquo;s very good for our first CTF.
I learnt a lot from this CTF, especially about what I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.
As you can see, Reconnaissance and Forensics were our strongest categories.</description></item><item><title>HTB forensics challenge: oBfsC4t10n #93</title><link>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/htb-challenge-93/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://brianstadnicki.github.io/posts/htb-challenge-93/</guid><description>Introduction I started analysing this from finding it on the malware sandbox any.run, only at the end do I notice that it&amp;rsquo;s a Hack The Box challenge.
