Property management services currently manage their tradesmen through calling, which is expensive, so I decided to write a SaaS tool that would optimise this. No calling, just post a job and the tradesmen apply.
Development It&amp;rsquo;s written in ruby on rails, which was honestly quite painful to get started on. I&amp;rsquo;m not typically involved in web development, so it was quite a giant learning curve, felt like the learning curve of Eve.</description></item></channel></rss>
