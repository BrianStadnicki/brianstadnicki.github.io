It doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to have been involved in any significant incidents yet, a few minecraft players don&amp;rsquo;t count. Unsurprisingly therefore, the sample has not had a single transaction to the wallet.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t very complicated, as likely a simple proof-of-concept ransomware. Simply a 32bit .NET executable, with the ransom wallpaper base64 encoded in and completely unobfuscated with names.</description></item></channel></rss>
