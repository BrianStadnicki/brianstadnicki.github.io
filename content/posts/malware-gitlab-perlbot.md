Last year, a major RCE was found in GitLab, [CVE-2021-22205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22205), where GitLab versions >= 11.9 and <13.10.3 were affected due to improper image validation before passing it to a file parser.

## Malicious image

The [DjVu](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/DjVu) image is considered a legacy format, so not much attention has been paid to it. The GitLab RCE depends on a vulnerability in ExifTool, [CVE-2021-22204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22204), where improper parsing of annotations, including a dangerous `eval` to add quotes to a string, caused an RCE. A patch was created on the 13th April 2021 in this [commit](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/commit/cf0f4e7dcd024ca99615bfd1102a841a25dde031#diff-fa0d652d10dbcd246e6b1df16c1e992931d3bb717a7e36157596b76bdadb3800L233).

## Loader script

### Temporary memory file system

The script clears the temporary memory file system and creates the folder `/dev/shm/kthzabor`, which is an attempt to prevent the [kthzabor](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/process-gitlab-named-kthzabor-is-using-90-of-cpu/61220) mining malware from working.

### Process killing

#### Hardcoded list

Many processes are attempted to be killed, such as databases, miners, various other malware, task managers and both defensive and offensive security tools.

#### PBot

`pbotbyjanhotzu` is likely a competing malware, but it doesn't appear to have been reported on.

#### Network server killing

Any processes listening on ports associated with mining malware are also killed.

#### Mining malware killing

![](/posts/malware-gitlab-perlbot/loader-mining-malware.png)

Processes with names possibly linked to mining malware such as [sysrv-hello](https://www.lacework.com/blog/sysrv-hello-expands-infrastructure/) are killed. Mining processes are often very simply, where a regular script is executed with the pool ip address as an argument, so these are also killed.

#### Payload execution

Finally a perl script is fetched and executed.

## Payload

The payload itself appears to be called "Stealth Shellbot", which appears to have been in use since at least the 23rd Nov 2015. It appears to be adapted from "ShellBOT", found on [github](https://github.com/Shadow-Network/perl-scripts/blob/master/Stealth%20ShellBot%20Verson%200.2.pl). The authors may be Portuguese.

### Connection

The bot connects to an IRC server and joins a channel.

### Commands

Command         | Action
----------------|----------------------------------------------
VERSION         | Sends back the bot version
PING            | Sends back PONG
portscan        | Scans ports 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 143 on a host
download        | Downloads a payload
fullportscan    | Scans a port range on a host
udp             | UDP flood
udpfaixa        | UDP range flood
conback         | Opens a reverse shell
oldpack         | Sends back a status message

### Evasion

The main evasion technique used is changing the process name to "/usr/local/apache/bin/httpd -DSSL".
