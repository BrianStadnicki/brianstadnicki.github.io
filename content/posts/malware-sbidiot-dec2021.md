The SBIDIOT IoT malware was observed earlier this year in april. Recently I spotted a sample with a cryptominer added on, so let's see what's changed.

The botnet's main use is for DDOS attacks on game servers.

# Overview

## Author

I took a look at one of the past versions of this malware:

```
3e948a7995faac6975af3c8c937c66e6b5733cb69dab5d2b87ba4c22e23ef136
```

![past string](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/past_author_str.png)

It appears that the author could be `selfrepnetis`, who's instagram is likely @selfrepnetis and @selfrepnetis_.

![ReBirth](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/rebirth_screenshots.png)

Based on the instagram, it appears that this botnet is likely being used for `RebirthRebornV2`, `RebirthVPN`, `RebirthReboot1.5`, `Rebirth Stress Hub`. This seems consistent with the OVH bypass patches listed when googling the tag on [Noirth](https://noirth.com/threads/anonghost720-packetguard-and-smalldoink-release-on-anti-ddos.8716/).

It appears that SBIDIOT is related to [DemonBot](https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/10/new-demonbot-discovered/), whose source code is available on [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/QE2GDrvS). It looks quite similar, it's possible that SBIDIOT is based on DemonBot.

## Version History

Thanks to [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/), I believe I have the majority of the versions of SBIDIOT, 20 of them.
Most of these names are from the banner sent to the C&C server, some are from a string.

# Latest version analysis

I'll do an in-depth analysis of the latest version of the botnet, specifically

```
fc0ce41c62734d55e257fcfdfb9118fddb5f0b49646a5731e779570b751ba2ee
```

## Initial shell script

The analysis starts at a shell script, which does the following:
 - Download a binary for the specific architecture from `20.106.163.35`, `[arch].keen.onion.1337`
 - Names it SSH and runs
 - Downloads a generic shell script from `20.106.163.35` and names it systemd
 - Runs it with `37.187.95.110:443` and an unidentified address

 ![Initial shell script](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/initial-script.png)

 `20.106.163.35` appears to be an Azure virtual machine, and `37.187.95.110` appears to be OVH instance.

The binary downloaded is named `cnrig`, then it's renamed to `systemd`. It's likely this is CNRig, which is a ["Static CryptoNight CPU miner for Linux"](https://github.com/cnrig/cnrig).

The binary named `[arch].keen.onion.1337` is the main malware binary that I'll be analysing.

### Unpacking

As with previous versions, this is packed with UPX and later modified.

![DIE shows that packed with UPX and modified](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/keen-die-upx-packed.png)

The modification here is again, the same as  previous versions, changing the `UPX!` signature for `YTS\x99`.

![Bytes of modified header](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/keen-upx-modification-bytes.png)

Once the instances of `YTS\x99` are replaced with `UPX!`, it can be unpacked.

### Main

#### Init garbage data

First of all, the seeds for the generation of garbage data for most packet attacks are generated.

![Init garbage data](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/main_init_bulk.png)

#### Network setup

Then it attempts to connect to `8.8.8.8` to make sure there is internet access.

If there is internet, then it reads `/proc/net/route` up until `\t00000000\t` to get the name of the default gateway, and sets the socket to use that gateway.

![Set the gateway](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/main_gateway.png)

#### Process forking

It attempts to fork itself, where if the exit code is unsucessful then it exits.

#### Banner

The bot now sends a coloured banner to the command server, `[Fuze] [ %s ] [ %s ]`. The text, apart from the brackets, is coloured red. The first `%s` contains the architecture, and the second contains the address of the command server.

Because of the command server address being sent and it being coloured, I believe that when the command server receives this, it prints it directly to a console/logs for the owner to read.

![Send the banner](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/main_banner.png)

#### Command parsing

It appears that first whitespace is trimmed from the start and end of the input command's data.

![Trim whitespace](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/main_parse_trim.png)

The command word itself is at the start of the packet.

![Command at start of packet](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/main_parse_command.png)

The number of arguments is determined.

![Number of arguments](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/main_parse_args.png)

### C&C commands

When SBIDIOT was released, there was originally 16 commands, now there are 41 commands:

```
ALPHA, HXTPA, R6, PUBG, FN, 2K, ARK, BO4, FUZE, OVHHEX, OVHRAW, CHOOPA, LAGOUT, HYDRASYN, NFOV6, HOTSPOT, UDPRAPE, CF-DOWN, OVHEXP, HYDRA, OVH-TCP, ARCADE, REVENGE, WIFI, FUCK, SHIT, KYS, STOMP, CRUSH, RAW, POXI, XMAS, HTTPSTOMP, RGAME, STD, CUH, OVH-TCP, ACID, HAMMED, HTTPS, STOP, Stop, stop
```

However, there are only 11 functions, many of these are different names for the same action.

The C&C server's address is still hardcoded, in this case at `54.37.79.0:666`, another OVH server.

#### ALPHA

The ALPHA command is used to send TCP segments to a specfic host and port for a set period of time.

Arguments:
 - address
 - unidentified
 - time length
 - unidentified
 - tcp flags
 - packet length (maybe)
 - number of packets to send

![TCP flags supported](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/command_alpha_tcp_flags.png)

#### HXTPA

The HXTPA command is used to send HTTP 1.1 PATCH requests to a specific hostname for a set period of time. The useragent is picked randomly from a list.

Arguments:
 - hostname
 - port
 - time length
 - number of packets

![code](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/command_hxtpa_code.png)

#### GAME group

The GAME commands appear to be a group of commands related to games, all calling the same function, but with different names.

Commands: R6, PUBG, FN, 2K, ARK, BO4.

arguments:
 - address
 - appears unused
 - duration
 - socket type
 - data send seed
 - number of packets to send
 - pause every number of packets
 - duration of pause


#### Scary attack names

This group of commands sends a byte to a host over a socket, connects and then waits for a set duration before closing it.

Commands: FUZE, OVHHEX, OVHRAW, CHOOPA, LAGOUT, HYDRASYN, NFOV6, HOTSPOT, UDPRAPE, CF-DOWN, OVHEXP, HYDRA, OVH-TCP, ARCADE, REVENGE, WIFI, FUCK, SHIT, KYS, STOMP, CRUSH, RAW.

The byte sent over is randomly picked from `/73x/6ax/x4a`, and interestingly, the length of this data sent is randomly picked between 1093 and 1193, with odds of 19:41.

arguments:
 - hostname
 - port
 - duration

![code](/posts/malware-sbidiot-dec2021/command_scary_attack_names.png)

#### UDP

This simply sends packets to an address several times for a duration.

arguments:
 - address
 - undetermined
 - duration
 - packet length
 - packet count
 - magic value

#### POXI

This sends a packet to a host, connects and then waits before closing it.

Interestingly, the packet payload is:

```
Payload:
    4E/x31/x6B/x4B/x31/x20/x21/x73/x69/x20/x4D/x33/x75/x79/x20/x4C/x30/x56/x72/x33/x20/x3C/x33/x20/x50/x61/x32/x72/x43/x48/x20/x4D/x32/x20/x41/x34/x34/x72/x43/x4B

    N1kK1 !si M3uy L0Vr3 <3 Pa2rCH M2 A44rCK
```

Make of that what you will.

arguments:
 - hostname
 - port
 - duration
 - packet length

#### XMAS

This sends packets to an address for a duration.

arguments:
 - address
 - possibly packet type
 - duration
 - undetermined
 - packet length
 - packet count

#### HTTPSTOMP

HTTPSTOMP sends a HTTP request to a specified host a set number of times and with a duration. The user agent is random, and the path is hardcoded bytes it seems.

Afterwards, it sends requests to `/cdn-cgi/l/chk_captcha`, in order to try to bypass a cloudfare captcha.

```
Payload: /x78/xA3/x69/x6A/x20/x44/x61/x6E/x6B/x65/x73/x74/x20/x53/x34/xB4/x42/x03/x23/x07/x82/x05/x84/xA4/xD2/x04/xE2/x14/x64/xF2/x05/x32/x14/xF4/
```

arguments:
 - http operation
 - address
 - port
 - unused
 - duration
 - packet count

#### RGAME

This command sends packets to a host for a duration, pausing sometimes.

arguments:
 - hostname
 - undetermined
 - duration
 - undetermined
 - packet length
 - packet count
 - pause threshold
 - pause duration

#### Diseases group

These commands send some data to a host, then connects and disconnects after a set period of time.

```
Payload: /x6f/x58/x22/x2e/x04/x92/x04/xa4/x42/x94/xb4/xf4/x44/xf4/x94/xd2/x04/xb4/xc4/xd2/x05/x84/xb4/xa4/xa6/xb3/x24/xd4/xb4/xf4/xa5/x74/xf4/x42/x04/x94/xf2/x24/xf5/x02/x03/xc4/x45/x04/xf5/x14/x44/x23
```

Commands: STD, CUH, OVH-TCP, ACID, HAMMED, HTTPS.

arguments:
 - hostname
 - port
 - duration

#### RAW

This repeatedly sends a string to a host and connects for a specific duration.

```
Payload:
    /x50/x33/x43/x4B/x24/x54/x20/x47/x38/x33/x41/x52/x44/x20/x30/x4E/x20/x54/x30/x50/x20/x50/x38/x54/x43/x48/x20/x49/x54/x20/x42/x22/x42/x59/

    P3CK$T G83ARD 0N T0P P8TCH IT B"BY
```

arguments:
 - hostname
 - port
 - duration

#### STOP/Stop/stop

Here all the process' children are SIGKILL'd.

# Conclusion

I think I've covered fairly well the main functionality of this bot, but I've left some of the arguments as unused or undefinied. I belive most of these are for setting a flag in the packet, but I'm not confident on that.

Many of the commands are quite similar in their functionality, so it's possible that I've missed some details.

Overall, it does what it's meant to do and there aren't fancy tricks.
